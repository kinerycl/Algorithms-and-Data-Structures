Feedback: 
It took me a while to get started because I didn't understand how to implement insertion sort with a linked list. My insertion sort does work but not in the "traditional" way that was described in the lecture slides. It would have been nice if the instructions were more clear with that because I'm still unsure if I completed insertion sort in the way which was intended.
